# Public-Key-Hash Addresses

Single-key addresses are addresses that authorize a single key to perform transfers from the address.
Early generations of single-key addresses are known as pay-to-public-key-hash addresses because they specify the hash of the public key that can spend from the address.

## Library Imports

```typescript
import * as btc from 'micro-btc-signer'
import { hex } from '@scure/base' 
```

## SegWit Public Key Hash

### Code

```typescript
const ecdsaPublicKey = hex.decode('030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001')

const scriptInfo = btc.p2wpkh(ecdsaPublicKey)

const script = hex.encode(scriptInfo.script)
const address = scriptInfo.address
```

### Console

```typescript
> console.log(script)
0014168b992bcfc44050310b3a94bd0771136d0b28d1
> console.log(address)

```

## Classic Public Key Hash

### Code

```typescript
const ecdsaPublicKey = hex.decode('030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001')

const scriptInfo = btc.p2pkh(ecdsaPublicKey)

const script = hex.encode(scriptInfo.script)
const address = scriptInfo.address
```

### Console

```typescript
> console.log(script)

> console.log(address)

# Key Creation

Key creation requires first creating a private key and then deriving a public key.
The public key is the public identity of the spender and is used to generate the address.
The private key is used to privately generate a signature and authorize a withdrawal.

### Library Imports

```typescript
import * as secp from '@noble/secp256k1'
```

### Generating a Private Key

```typescript
const privateKey = secp.utils.randomPrivateKey()
```

### Deriving an ECDSA Public Key from a Private Key

```typescript
const ecdsaPublicKey = secp.getPublicKey(privateKey, true)
```

### Deriving a Schnorr Public Key from a Private Key

```typescript
const schnorrPublicKey = secp.schnorr.getPublicKey(privateKey)
```
